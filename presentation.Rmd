<!-- General Outline: -->
<!-- Colin (30m) - Intro to how a computer works and some parallelization exercises -->
<!-- Maria (30m) - Walk through an example on the SEFS servers -->
<!-- Abby (30m) - Walk through an example on Hyak -->

# Objectives

# Why Parallelize?

<!-- I (Abby) think it would be good to say something about code profiling also -->
<!-- And thinking through when your code is memory intensive vs. cpu intensive, how a computer works, etc -->

# How to Access the QERM/SEFS Servers

# A Basic R Program

# How to Access Hyak

<!-- Outline: -->
<!-- 1. What is hyak?  -->
<!-- 2. How does hyak work? -->
<!-- 3. How to log in -->
<!-- 4. How to upload files -->
<!-- 5. How to write a batch script (things you submit to slurm) -->
<!-- 6. How to submit a job -->
<!--   6bonus - wait, what if I need a special library or piece of software? -->
<!-- 7. How to check what's happening in the queue -->
<!-- 8. How to download finished results -->
<!-- 9. How to game slurm (requesting memory, etc strategically so you get high priority) -->
<!-- 10. Where do get help doing things more advanced than this (multinode stuff, working in languages that need to be compiled, etc) -->

## What is hyak?

## How does hyak work?

## How do I log in?

Open a terminal window. Type

```
ssh UWNETID@mox.hyak.uw.edu
```

Follow two-factor authentication instructions. 

You're in!

<!-- Only works if you have access to Hyak, of course! -->

## How do I upload files?

## What is a batch script?

## How do I write a batch script?

Short answer: don't. Modify a template! Here's a start:

## How do I submit a job to the queue?

## Wait, what if I need some special library or software?

## When will my jobs run?

## My job finished! How do I download my results?

## How can I get higher priority in the queue?

## Bonus tip: Stop typing your GitHub password all the time

<!-- setup ssh key on github -->

## Where do I get help?
